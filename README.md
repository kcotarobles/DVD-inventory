# DVD-inventory

The inventory has methods for adding new movies and removing movies, as well as a method which returns a boolean value for whether the movie is already contained in the inventory. There is also a toString() method, and a method which returns the size of the inventory. The inventory utilizes Collections.sort to sort the movies by the year they were released.
